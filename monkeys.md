Peter
Proboscis

A real family monkey. Everything he does is for his beloved monkey wife and kids. Some say he doesn't know what he's doing. He neither acknowledges nor denies this.

Mitch
Macaque

A real sweet tooth, looking for sweet deals. Scavenging the market for opportunities to feast on. Leaving no stone unturned. Calls himself “the Almighty Mitch”. No one else does, though.

Gary
Gorilla

Part time trader. Part time chest drummer. Worried about the increasing silver gray hairs on his back. Worries too much. Worries about worrying too much.

Penelope
Proboscis

Convinced she can smell a good deal from miles away. Has a cold almost all year round. Goes around sniffing and sneezing, keeping others at bay.

Omar
Orangutan

With a name that means “flourishing”, he thinks he surely is destined to be prosperous. If only he wouldn't be distracted as often as he is. Like, all the time.

Camilla
Chimpanzee

Don't be fooled by her looks. Knows how to handle herself in alpha-territory. Will not be intimidated by loud-mouths. Always on the lookout for new opportunities to invest in.

Caesar
Chimpanzee

Looking to dominate any market he enters. Puts a ring of leaves on top of his head to look intimidating. Acts like the market is his empire. Has a hard time listening to advice from others.

Giulia
Gorilla


Everything she does is with full conviction and a bit over the top. Loves to gossip. In particular about Mya the Macaque. Has no regrets. Ever.

Mabel
the Macaque

Looks so lovable, but has the sharpest fangs. She's quick on her feet and has unparalleled reaction speed. She gets distracted fairly easily, although she won't admit that.

Charlie
Chimpanzee

Always looking for momentum to jump in on a fair trade. Because, well… he just loves jumping. And bananas. Jumping and bananas, yes. Those are the two things that make Charlie happy.

Pablo
Proboscis

Thinks he has a real nose for profitable trading opportunities. Pretty dominant and sly. Keeps confronting others with the ultimatum “plata o plomo”. Nobody knows what he means by that. Or takes him seriously, for that matter.

Olivia
Orangutan

Likes to dream big. Sometimes it's almost as if she knows what the future holds. At other times, she's just like the rest of the group; laid back and lazy.

Orson
Orangutan

Abides by a very strict trading protocol: never trade on an empty stomach. Also suffers from periods of insatiable hunger. Making him the most whimsical monkey in the history of trading monkeys.

Casey
Chimpanzee

Full name Cassandra. Casey for short. But she knows how to play the long game too. Always vigilant and with her eyes on the prize. Don't try to distract her while trading. She'll go bananas

George
Gorilla

Working remote out of the jungle. Has big ambitions. Has big fingers too, making it hard to push the right buttons on his smartphone.

Mya
Macaque

Mya is regarded as the mother of the pack. Overseeing the bigger picture. Lovable, but also fairly slow and indecisive. Rumor has it she's named after a 20th century pop idol. But that's just gorilla gossip.

Max
Macaque

Grunts alot while working the numbers. If he's not spending time trading, he's grooming his crest. This ambitious monkey loves a tough nut to crack. But he likes fruit as well.

Paris
Proboscis
Is all about the looks. Keeps pet dogs with names like “Gem Baby“, “SeaShell Sweetheart“ and “Marilyn Mondoe“. Wants to become filthy rich with the least amount of effort.

Gina
Gorilla
Self-proclaimed queen of the archipelago. Calls herself “The Royal Trader“. Has a throne made out of banana peels. Always snapping at her pet snapping turtle for being too slow.

Olga
Orangutan
Has the memory of an elephant. Can name every transaction that has ever occurred. Hasn't figured out how to use all this knowledge to her advantage. Scratches her head every other minute.
